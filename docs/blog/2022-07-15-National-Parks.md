# America the Beautiful

In 2019 I took a trip to Utah to see the Mighty Five, 5 amazing National Parks in Utah and it opened my eyes to see more of the most beautiful places in America.
I couldn't believe how incredible these public lands are in our backyard.
The National Parks are now some of my favorite trips and places to visit, they recharge my soul and inspire me see the history and wonder of our most sacred grounds.
This is where I hope to add pictures, stories, suggestions on trails and experiences from the past that could help someone else see this beauty.

This past summer in 2022 I visited Montana for the first time and fell in love with the city of Missoula, The mountains of Glacier and Flat Head Lake.
