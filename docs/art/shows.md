## **My First Show - Debut **

I'm taking a break from Software Engineering.

I had my first show on Friday, August 11th 2023.<br>
It was incredible, had my turntables/wax and dropped my favorite Hip Hop tracks and some of my own raps/freestyles/poetry.<br>
The 50th Anniversary of Hip Hop was such a great experience in Austin.<br>
