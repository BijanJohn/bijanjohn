When Bijan is not performing he is typically reading books, listening to vinyl records, crafting his artistry through different forms of expression and learning how to make a small business grow.<br>
Bijan has been influenced greatly by the lyricists of Hip Hop who were concerned with Mastery, with the timeless art of freestyle (making things up on the spot) and open mic culture.<br>
