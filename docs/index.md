![Bijan](assets/images/bijan-and-thom.jpg){ align=left }

Howdy! You found me on the internet :), this is my personal website to share with the rest of the digital world.
I am a first generation Persian (Iranian) American who grew up in Austin, Texas.
I have spent the last 10 years working in software engineering and now am on my 2nd career becoming a Hip Hop Artist.
I am a big fan of the following. 

* Hiking up Mountains
* Meditation/Sauna/Cold Plunges/Yoga/Lifting Weights/Running/Float Tanks
* Learning in public
* Poetry, Rapping, Freestyling

I am looking forward to more updates to come.
