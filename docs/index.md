### Love is all that is real

Love is all that is real<br>
it shows up in greetings cards and poetry open mics<br>
hugs, smiles and gathering with delicious food<br>
when asking how to improve<br>
use more love, it is what is true<br>
feeds our soul and heart<br>
the expressions in words, actions and art<br>
part with the ideas of representation<br>
to see the nothing underneath<br>
the sensations of Love complete, Love Supreme<br>
it is always here, now<br>
we are allowed this sublime infinite expanse<br>
this Love is an ecstatic dance<br>
it is what made the Sufi's whirl in trance<br>
history shows our poets with the same message<br>
embedded in different methods<br>
poured in different drinks<br>
Love changes how we think<br>
it grows our capacity to heal<br>
Love knows no expectations<br>
needs no confirmation<br>
Love is what we feel<br>
it is a miracle<br>
that Love is all that is real<br>

### Christmas Day

Birthday wishes granted, Christmas packaging unwrapped<br>
with poetry tape handling how we keep this love on tap<br>
makeshift, make the shift into making new shifts with position<br>
the first lesson is always make moments to listen<br>
in between the stimulus and response there is this decision<br>
wholehearted Love and Soul living<br>
with your friends, family, mentors and children<br> 
the way it happens by itself like intuition<br>
you don't have to push hard to see how things fall in<br>
places, people and things<br>
tall order of our best times together<br>
wishing to savor, the interconnectedness is never severed<br>
the energy and emptiness goes on forever<br>
it's all you've ever seen, and it is enough<br>
sometimes holidays are the tough stuff<br>
wherever ever you are at, it's the perfect time and place, to be looking up<br>
with grace and gratitude we offer blessings and tip our cup<br>

He studies under the tutelage of the greatest living American Poet, [Thom the World Poet](https://thomworldpoet.blogspot.com/), who is known to drop improvised verse at open mics of the city and has a compulsion to write and share poetry from the depths of love.<br>
<br>
When Bijan is not performing he is typically reading books, listening to vinyl records, crafting his artistry through different forms of expression and learning how to make a small business grow.<br>
Bijan has been influenced greatly by the lyricists of Hip Hop who were concerned with Mastery, with the timeless art of freestyle (making things up on the spot) and open mic culture.<br>
