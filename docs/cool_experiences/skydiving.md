Jumping out of planes might seem insane<br>
the feelings of fear change and re-arrange<br>
perspective is my favorite part of the brain<br>
teaching ourselves to be even more highly trained<br>

My excitement is one of my favorite qualities<br>
Equanimity, Stoicism and a capricious wisdom<br>
Engineering paths to freedom and graphs of the larger lump sum<br>
my favorite ones are most simple in principle<br>

It took time to learn to stand tall<br>
even more time to embrace the fall<br>
visualizing the drop while taking cold showers a lot<br>
now cold showers are how I cool off in the Texas hot<br>

Went for a run to Barton Springs<br>
saw James on his 60th with family relaxing<br>
in a few hours jumped out the flying bus<br>

With Love you have to trust<br>
There will always be a way<br>
give more than you take away<br>
for it is the way<br>
